# Map of NZ Rovers Crews

Stupidly simple map of some of New Zealand's Rover Crews. Designed as a proof of concept for a find-your-crew type site.

## Crew Info
Details of each crew are loaded from the `crews.json` file and are of the form:

```json
  {
    "name": "Deans",
    "location": "Riccarton, Christchurch",
    "position": {"lat": -43.5261, "lng": 172.5966}
  }
```
Pull requests for details of additional crews or corrections are encouraged.
